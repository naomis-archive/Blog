# Blog

This repository contains my blog posts and main blog page.

## Become an Author

If you would like to submit an article to the blog, you are welcome to create a pull request to do so!

Your pull request should contain a new article file within the `Posts` folder. The file should be titled with the date you wrote the article, in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Use the same format as the other articles when creating yours.

You will also need to add a link to your article on the main `index.html` file. Place the link underneath the `new blog posts here` comment, using the same structure as the other links.
