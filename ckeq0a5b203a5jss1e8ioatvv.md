## Technology Wars

Even before you became a developer, you have probably heard people get into technology wars. You may have heard statements like "Apple is way better than Android", or "I can't believe you use a MacBook". These types of statements are commonplace, unfortunately, and they do *nothing* beneficial for the tech community as a whole. 

## Preferences

EVERYONE has preferences for the technology they use. Those preferences can be for specific frameworks (Angular instead of Vue), languages (Python instead of JavaScript), operating systems (Windows instead of Mac), or even hardware (The Intel-AMD discussions are endless). And that is *okay* - it is natural to have your preferences. What is *not* okay is belittling someone else for having **different** preferences. As a community, we need to change the dynamic of these discussions to remain inclusive and open to all of our members. 

As an example, I vastly prefer Android to iOS. I can list out and communicate my reasons for that choice, and am happy to do so when someone asks. I prefer Android because:
- I have more options for devices and device manufacturers
- I have more freedom with the interface and OS
- I am not restricted to using specific applications for specific functions

If someone asks about my preference, I gladly engage in the discussion. But there are things that need to be avoided when having this type of conversation:

## Avoid negative statements

It is important that we do not put someone down for their choice in technology. Here are some examples of phrases to avoid:

- "I cannot believe you use an iPhone. What is wrong with you?" -- This can make someone feel like their preferences make them inferior, which is not true. 
- "The XBox is stupid. PlayStation all the way" -- Again, belittling another person's preference accomplishes nothing and shuts down a discussion. 

Instead, keep the discussion focused on *quantifiable observations*. Here are some examples of more welcoming phrases:

- "I am not a fan of how restrictive the iOS feels" -- A subjective observation, rather than stating something as factual. 
- "I find that Angular is easier to understand, and logically makes more sense to me than React" -- Keeps the observation *personal*, instead of factual.
- "The exclusive games available on the XBox are more interesting to me than those on the PlayStation" -- Again, you can share your opinion as an *opinion* instead of a fact. 

## In Conclusion

It is good to keep an open mind and a welcoming demeanour when having these types of conversations. Not only does it ensure that a potential future developer is not discouraged, but you might even learn something new that changes your own preference!
