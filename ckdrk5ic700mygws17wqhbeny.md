## Some Updates

Hello readers! I have some things to share today that are not necessarily related to coding or development, but ARE related to this blog.

## Content

My blog started as a personal website built by hand and hosted on GitHub Pages. When I discovered Hashnode and migrated my blog to this new platform, I changed the nature of the blog to focus more on technical articles and tutorials. This meant I would not migrate my old blog posts, and instead would start fresh. Hashnode seemed to be a platform targeted toward this type of content, rather than personal blog content. 

The downside to this approach has been a sudden loss of inspiration for content! I find myself lacking ideas for post topics, which has been a complete struggle. If you have something you'd like me to write about, let me know in the comments section below!

## Post Schedule

My original plan was to continue my schedule of writing new posts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The lack of inspiration has made this untenable, and I am going to scale back to twice a week posting. Going forward, I plan to post on Wednesdays and Saturdays. 

## What's Next?

I am still unsure of what direction to take this blog. Should it be stories of my journey becoming a developer? Should it offer a glimpse into my personal life? Or should it remain the technical content it has been the past couple of weeks? 

Ultimately, I think the best answer for this comes from the audience. As the reader, the content of my blog should be relevant to your interests. What do you want to see from this blog?
