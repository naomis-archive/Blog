## 2 Articles 1 Week

For those who are unaware, Hashnode presents a challenge to its members: The #2Articles1Week challenge. 

The challenge is simple: Post two articles every week, for up to 8 weeks. The reward? Fancy badges on your Hashnode profile. More importantly, an improvement in your writing skills and a potential to expand your audience. 

## My Commitment

This post serves as my commitment to participating in the #2Articles1Week challenge. It has always been my goal to maintain a regular post schedule on this blog: Post every Wednesday and Saturday. That *should* already qualify me for the challenge, right? 

A slight problem, there. While I've *tried* to maintain a regular posting schedule, I have skipped a day here and there when the inspiration for a story failed to hit. It is my hope that by joining this challenge I will be more accountable for maintaining that schedule. 

Additionally, I've established a small network of fellow bloggers to encourage each other and ensure we all succeed in this challenge (and our other endeavours as well)! If you are facing the same struggle with maintaining a regular post schedule - do not fret. You are not alone. Feel free to drop a comment below and I'll send some encouragement your way!

Make sure to follow the blog to see the results, and if you'd like to participate as well... Sign up and start writing! üòÅ Hashnode also offers a Discord server where you can communicate with other members and find the motivation you need to stay on track!
