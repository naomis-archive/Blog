## Escaping the Tutorial Hell

A lot of people love tutorials. But not all tutorials are solid, and it can become very easy to get *stuck* on following tutorials, thus never moving forward to build your own app. Today I am going to share my thoughts on what makes a tutorial effective, what the infamous "tutorial hell" looks like, and how to break away from that cycle. 

## What makes a tutorial effective?

In my opinion, quite a few tutorials are very *ineffective*. I have seen a good number of tutorials that say "How to build a Facebook Clone" and walk you through the steps - these tutorials will spoon feed you code to write, file structures to set up, and packages to install. But far too often these tutorials fail to explain the *why* behind the code. 

Development is not as simple as copy-pasting blocks of code (though having reusable code can make life easier). It is more about being able to  understand what the code does, how it works, and why it works. A developer can look at a problem and see different ways to approach a solution, then determine which way is most effective. 

A solid tutorial, then, will not merely provide you with blocks of code to copy. Instead, it should be walking through what the code does, how it works, and the **core concepts** behind the ideas. A very solid example of this is the [Angular Tour of Heroes](), an official tutorial for learning the bare basics of Angular. I went through this tutorial myself, and found that not only were the explanations in depth, but the tutorial even had me write bugged and broken code! This was very effective in demonstrating some of the common errors that a developer might face with the framework, and showed some approaches to debugging those errors. 

## What is tutorial hell?

Many of you may have heard the term before. But for those who have not: "tutorial hell" is the term used to describe a state in which a developer (usually new developers) continuously searches for tutorials to follow and never breaks away to build a project from scratch. Often times, this happens when someone is feeling a lack of confidence in their abilities, or finds the idea of starting from scratch daunting. 

## How to escape tutorial hell?

There is really only one way to escape tutorial hell... You have to take the plunge and build something on your own. 

Of course, "on your own" doesn't mean you sit in a cave and speak to no one. Development, especially from scratch, can and will involve a lot of research. And that's okay! It is important to know what to ask, when to ask it, how to ask it, and who to ask. 

Personally, when I find a *very* helpful tutorial, the very first thing I do after finishing it is go build something else using the same concepts. When I finished the Angular tutorial, my very next project was to refactor my [portfolio](https://www.nhcarrigan.com) into an Angular app. There *was* no tutorial for this, nor did I look for one. But I *did* reference the tutorial I had already completed, along with the rest of the Angular documentation. 

And that is okay! It is good to reference resources to help you, but I challenge you to move away from the tutorials and start trying your own code. Don't be afraid to break it - I break code on a daily basis. And finally, familiarise yourself and get comfortable with reading the official documentation. 

I have faith that you, too, can escape the tutorial hell! Good luck and happy coding!
