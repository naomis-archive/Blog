      <h1>Making the Jump Into React</h1>
      <p class="small">23 July 2020</p>
      <p>
        My first experience with React was in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and
        to be honest it was a total slog. I felt overwhelmed by the amount of
        information, confused by the material, and all around defeated by the
        idea of learning React. I distinctly remember thinking "This makes
        absolutely no sense to me and why would anyone use it?". It came across
        as an unnecessarily complicated method of building a webpage.

        However, with the significant demand for React knowledge in the
        developer market for my area, I know it is something I need to spend
        serious time learning. Today was the day I decided to finally take the
        plunge. Following a tutorial on the Reactjs.org webpage (with help from
        another tutorial for setting up a local environment and publishing to
        GitHub Pages) I made my first app - a Tic-Tac-Toe game with the ability
        to travel back in time to previous moves.

        I have to say, I am feeling a great deal more confident about learning
        React now. I am not normally a fan of following tutorials (and often
        advise against it) because there is too much hand-holding - you gain a
        lot less knowledge from copying code than you do from writing it
        yourself. However, this tutorial was very well written and explained the
        steps at each point in the process. I am far from being an expert, by
        any means, but I feel that this has helped me gain some basic
        foundational understanding.
