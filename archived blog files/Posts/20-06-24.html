      <h1>I Seem to Have Reached a Bit of Stagnation</h1>
      <p class="small">24 June 2020</p>
      <p>
        For the past few days, now, I've had a significant lack of ideas for
        development projects. I have done some updates to my bot, and to the
        test bot code we are working on for FreeCodeCamp. But I find I have yet
        to feel inspiration for a new project. I know I need to work on the
        front-end for the E-Commercify project, but the couple of attempts I
        have made to start that are unsuccessful (I need to revisit React and
        learn how it works again).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also thought about creating a React page from scratch (to get a
        feel for the process, and be able to apply it to the aforementioned
        project). Again, though, my motivation has been sapped. Still, it is an
        idea, and one with which I will follow through. Eventually. Meanwhile, I
        will continue poking around with my Discord bot and helping FCC members
        work through the curriculum.
