      <h1>Building a MERN stack app with TypeScript</h1>
      <p class="small">25 July 2020</p>
      <p>
        Yesterday I started working on my very first MERN stack app. For those
        who do not know, the MERN stack is the use of MongoDB, Express, React,
        and node.js to build a fully functional app (both server-side and
        client-side). To further complicate things, I chose to use TypeScript
        rather than JavaScript (meaning an extra compile step during the build
        process).
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with a tutorial I had found on FreeCodeCamp's news page -
        following along with the tutorial, I was able to build the basic
        structure of the app (though I had to reference the source code, as well
        - one step in the tutorial was incorrect, I believe). The source code
        also provided the CSS styling for the app, which I adapted to give my
        own personal flair to the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting the app successfully functioning on my local machine
        yesterday, I decided to take on the challenge of deploying the app to a
        live instance with Heroku. YIKES - what a mess that turned out to be. I
        had been tweaking the files and scripts for a good couple of hours with
        no success, and broke my local instance in the process. To make matters
        worse, I had mistakenly done all of the work on the
        <em>master</em> branch of my repository...
      </p>
      <p>
        This meant that going "back in time" to a functioning version of the app
        was much trickier. I was able to move back in my commit history to the
        last functional code version, thankfully - then creating a branch from
        that version, forcing the master branch to revert to that version, and
        essentially travelling back in time to the last functional version.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid this issue in the future, I've now got a branch specifically
        for the local development instance, a branch for the production
        environment, and the master branch (which will likely not be touched).
        This should allow me to make changes to the code specifically for each
        intended environment, avoiding the absolute nightmare I faced today.
