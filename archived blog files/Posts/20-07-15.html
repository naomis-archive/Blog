      <h1>Discovering Habitica - the Online Task Manager</h1>

        One of my FreeCodeCamp friends turned me on to Habitica the other day. I
        had explored it a few years ago but never really stuck with it,
        primarily because I found it hard to keep up on every day. Now, though,
        between my smartphone and my computer I find it much easier.

        Habitica serves primarily as an online to-do list type app. You are able
        to add daily (or recurring) tasks, to-do items, and habits. Completing
        any task rewards you with experience, gold, and items (like an RPG).
        Missing a recurring task (a daily) will damage your health. There are
        myriad more features, from shops and quests to guilds and parties.
        Everything seems geared toward helping you stay on track with your goals
        and accountability.

        Personally, I've been using Habitica to manage my chores around the
        house as well as my coding projects and learning goals. While it has
        only been a few days, I have noticed that it is easier to focus and keep
        my tasks organised - things are less likely to get forgotten or lost in
        the shuffle. I've even included a reminder to post on my blog a little
        more regularly. :D
