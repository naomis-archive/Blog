      <h1>I Made A Blog!</h1>

      <p>
        Today is the day I decided to start a blog. To be fully honest, I am not
        entirely sure what I will be writing, or how often. I am not even sure
        that anyone will read it, but it seems like a decent idea for getting my
        thoughts out and sharing my ideas and experiences.
      </p>

        I have been spending a lot of my time learning how to code, which has
        been a very engaging and entertaining endeavour. I have enjoyed the
        process and the results, and have been making friends in the coding
        community I joined. I decided to purchase my own domain and set up my
        own webpage, which this blog is a part of. I still have a lot to learn,
        but I am making progress almost daily.

        I do spend a little time playing video games too, though not nearly as
        much as I used to. Maybe I'll start doing game reviews or something?
        Would be some good content for the blog, at least.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, I think that's all I've got for today. Wish me luck!</p>
