## An Introduction

# `Hello World~!`

Welcome to my (new) blog! My name is Naomi Carrigan, and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I am fairly new to the development world - I took the plunge back in April of 2020, and have not looked back. My experience began with the [FreeCodeCamp curriculum](https://freecodecamp.org), which was a completely new experience. I had absolutely *zero* familiarity with programming (I vaguely remember building a website back when I was 12, but that memory has long since escaped me), and this has turned into quite an adventure! I worked my way through the FCC curriculum, building a basic skill-set, and continue to seek new knowledge and grow my abilities.

## Why development?

I spent 10 years in the retail grocery industry, primarily in management roles, and quite often my supervisor would tell me "You should be working with computers, not groceries". I was known as the unofficial IT guy, because I could often fix a technology issue without having to call the help desk. Computers (and technology as a whole) have always been a major interest of mine, and I've been a gamer my entire life, so having the opportunity to find employment in a field that interests me is invaluable. Circumstances led to my unemployment, which opened up the time and opportunity to throw myself into this new venture.

I knew this was the route I wanted to go, but not how to go about it. I searched around for "teach yourself how to code", and ran across countless resources (all of which wanted money - not ideal, for my recently unemployed income). After a little more exploration, I discovered FreeCodeCamp. It was the first resource I saw that was both comprehensive and free, and I decided to give it a shot. This was one of the best decisions I have made. The curriculum covers the basics for everything one needs to know, and the community is welcoming and supportive.

## What's next?

I fully intend to continue learning and building my skills. There were portions of the learning that did not particularly click with me (React, D3...) and I intend to continue exploring those concepts to solidify my knowledge and skills. I will also continue to build my portfolio and work on my personal projects (my [Discord Bot](https://www.nhcarrigan.com/discord-bot-documentation) being my pride and joy at the moment). I will also attempt to post regularly on this new blog - depreciating my [old one](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/Blog/tree/master/archived%20blog%20files) in favour of this new platform.
