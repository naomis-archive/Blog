## Essential VSCode Extensions

When I first started setting up my local development environment, the IDE I chose was Atom - to be fair, I had no particular reason for choosing it. Atom just happened to be the first one I came across. 

Not that long ago, a fellow developer recommended I switch to VSCode. Atom is developed by GitHub, which was recently acquired by Microsoft. Microsoft is responsible for VSCode, and in the likely event that they decide not to maintain two IDEs... VSCode seems more likely to stick around. 

So I downloaded VSCode, and the wonderful world of the extension marketplace became my playground. Today I'd like to share the extensions that have become essential in my daily coding life. 

## ESLint and Prettier

[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) work in tandem to lint and format your code. Missing a semi-colon? Prettier will add that. Missing a bracket? ESLint will warn you. 

These extensions are not perfect, but can be very helpful in keeping your code readable and error free. 

## Bracket Pair Colorizer 2

[Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) does one thing and one thing only. It colour-codes your matching opening and closing brackets - `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. This can be **incredibly** helpful when you're writing function chains, stacks of conditionals, or even dealing with nested arrays. 

## Indent Rainbow

[Indent Rainbow]() adds background colours to your indented code, allowing you to quickly visualise your indent levels and ensure your code is indented properly. It is nothing too fancy, but incredibly helpful.

## Live Server

[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) allows you to launch a local development server from your code - this includes a live reload feature, so your changes to the code will be reflected in the page view. 

## Bonus!

These extensions aren't necessarily **essential**, but they ARE very very fun.

## vscode-icons

[vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons) adds icons to your files depending on the file type. It's nice to be able to take a quick glance at your files and find the .CSS you need to edit.

## Power Mode

[Power Mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode) is perfect for when your power level is over 9000. This extension adds a "combo meter" to your editor, which keeps track of how many characters you've typed without pause. It also adds explosions to your cursor - instead of writing code, explode the code!

## SynthWave '84

[SynthWave](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) is a theme which changes the colours of VSCode's syntax highlighting. But more importantly... it adds NEON GLOW! The extension can take a little tweaking to get the glow working, but it is 100% worth it.
