## Game Review - A Plague Tale: Innocence

*A Plague Tale: Innocence* is a stealth-based adventure game. The bulk of the game play focuses on the story and exploration, with stealth aspects and environment-based puzzles mixed in. The game is set in 14th century France, and focuses on two recently orphaned children Amicia and Hugo. As the player, you control Amicia for the primary portion of the game as the two children attempt to find their way and survive. Throughout your journey, you will narrowly escape the Inquisition and avoid being eaten alive by swarms of plague carrying rats.

## Gameplay

### Score: 7/10

The game play is decent. The stealth puzzles are done well, with multiple options for getting past an obstacle. As you progress, you obtain additional tools and skills to open up new possibilities. Do you sling a rock at the guard's head and kill him? Do you toss a pot to distract him? There are often multiple approaches to get past a given obstacle. Unfortunately, the game play does suffer in that these puzzles can get very repetitive. Facing a swarm of rats? Find the path of torches to light - the rats run from light. 

Where the game really takes a hit is in the boss battles. The first boss battle was enjoyable - not too challenging, and a nice culmination of the skills and items you've obtained by that part. The final boss battle, however, throws all of that out the window. Rather than leverage the environmental puzzle aspects or the significant number of items and their uses, the final boss battle involves a combination of pattern memorization, timing, and sheer luck.

## Graphics 

### Score: 8/10

The graphics in the game are great. The big focus was the play on light and shadows, and the game does this well. There are areas that successfully portray that erie sense of creep, and the play on shadows helps accomplish this. 

That being said, the graphics are not *overwhelming*. While I never ran in to moments where I thought "This looks terrible", I also never had that "Wow this looks like the real world" feeling.

## Story

### Score: 9/10

The story is really where this game shines. The tale managed to suck me in completely, and I found myself invested in the well being of the characters. Each turning point really pulled on the emotions, and the characters felt like real people.

My biggest complaint is how anti-climatic the ending felt. It sounds like there may be an alternate ending that I did not discover (likely requiring 100% completion of the game), but the conclusion I saw just felt empty.

## Audio

### Score: 8/10

The music in the game ties in well with the world the game has built. The tone of the music changes to match the emotional and physical environment, and helps create that emotional connection. Were I to have one complaint, it would be the moments where the music changes because an enemy has noticed you or a threat has appeared. Overall, however, it is nice to have a soundtrack that does not pull you out of the immersion. 

The voice acting is top-notch. The language was originally in French, I believe, but the voices have also been done in English. The accent is still true to the region, and the voices feel like they successfully bring life to the characters.

## Final Thoughts

### Total: 8/10

The game is absolutely phenomenal, right up until the final boss fight. Unfortunately, that left me feeling angry instead of satisfied. The game also has very little replay value. However, overall this game is a gem and well worth picking up.
