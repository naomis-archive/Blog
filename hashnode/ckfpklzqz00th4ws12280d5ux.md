## Hacktoberfest 2020~!

Tomorrow begins Hacktoberfest! For those who have not heard of this before, Hacktoberfest is a month-long event put together by Digital Ocean (and a few sponsors) with the goal of encouraging contributions to Open Source Software. Today we will discuss how to prepare for this event, either as a participant or a maintainer. But first, if you have not done so already, I encourage you to [sign up for Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

## Preparing as a Participant

Participating in Hacktoberfest is both a lot of fun and an excellent learning experience! The goal of the event is to submit at least four pull requests to open source projects on GitHub. While the first 70,000 participants to do this will win a T-Shirt (or a tree!), I encourage you to focus instead on what you can contribute and what you will learn. 

### Choosing a Project

Hacktoberfest will count PRs you make on your own projects as valid. However, I *strongly* encourage you to find other projects to contribute to, as the idea here is to give back to the community and expand your skills. Try to find something that will bring you out of your comfort zone. For example, I am a regular contributor to [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/learn), and I fully intend to continue contributing during this event. *However*, I will be specifically looking for other projects as well (my goal is to have at least four pull requests on new-to-me repositories). 

Finding a project to contribute to can be tough, but GitHub offers a very powerful search feature that can help. You can find repositories [by language, like TypeScript](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Atypescript), or find [good first issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), or look for repositories [actively participating in Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahacktoberfest). 

### Creating your PR

First and foremost, *be sure to read the contributing guidelines*. Maintaining an open source platform is a lot of work, and you want to respect the project maintainers' time and effort. Always read the contributing guidelines to understand the workflow and process for expressing interest in fixing an issue and submitting a PR.

Once you have done this, claim the issue you'd like to fix as outlined in those guidelines. Work on your proposed changes and submit your PR. I know it can be tempting to submit multiple PRs for the same fix, because the swag is cool, but you want *quality over quantity*. A general rule of thumb is your PR should be a comprehensive fix for the issue. 

Communication is key, as well. If you get stuck, or aren't sure which approach you should take, comment on the issue and ask for feedback. It is much better to have a clear plan of action before opening a PR than having to commit multiple times to get the fix in line with the repository's style standards.

## Preparing as a Maintainer

Maintaining an open source project is just as fun as contributing. Preparing your repository is important to ensure that contributors and participants can have a smooth and streamlined experience for submitting a pull request. 

### Contributing Guidelines

It is very important to have clear guidelines for contributions. How you host these guidelines is up to you - a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will interface nicely with GitHub's GUI for easy access, but if you'd rather have a separate website you can drop that link in your contributing file. 

Your guidelines should outline a few things:
* How does a new contributor set up a local instance of your project?
* How does a contributor claim an issue?
* What are your standards for submitting a pull request?

The goal is to make contributing easier for both a participant and for yourself as the project maintainer. 

### Creating Issues

Creating quality issues is essential for bringing new contributors to your project. An issue should be detailed and explicit, so avoid things like "This feature is broken and needs fixed". A well-structured issue will:
* Explain the feature or fix that is requested
* Propose a possible implementation for that request
* Identify where in the codebase a contributor can find the relevant files

Additionally, leverage the GitHub labels to maximise the visibility of your issue. The `help wanted` label will indicate the issue is open to external contributions. The `good first issue` or `first timers only` labels indicate that your issue is intended for contributors who have not worked with your codebase before. The `hacktoberfest` label will allow event participants to see your issue when looking for projects to contribute to. 

### Communication

Remember that Hacktoberfest can inspire a *lot* of newer developers to make their first contributions to open source software. Everyone has different skillsets, knowledge bases, and experience levels. Keep in mind that the comment on your issue comes from another person behind a screen, so be kind! Try to maintain a welcoming and friendly environment, and be willing to help contributors work through their proposed changes.

## In Conclusion

Hacktoberfest is a wonderful event to build your skills and expand your network (and give back to the open source community). I highly encourage everyone to participate, not just for the swag, but for all of the opportunities the event offers.
