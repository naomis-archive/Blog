## Task Management

As someone who is generally scattered, I find that I think of something to do and promptly forget it when I have the time to actually do it. If I write it down, I end up losing that note. Standard to-do apps often found themselves forgotten, or tossed aside because they worked only on one device. Then I found [Habitica](https://habitica.com/). 

## What is it?

Habitica is an online task-management app. What sets it apart is the "gamification" of the process - you create an avatar, and earn experience and levels by completing your tasks. You can also schedule daily (or repeating) tasks, which will damage you if left incomplete by day's end. You also earn gold which you can use to purchase new gear. There are guilds to join, you can form a party, and you can even do quests. The entire platform is geared toward creating a community that supports its members and a system that helps you stay accountable to your goals.

## How I use it

Regardless of what platform you choose to use, the ultimate result should be the same: Task management is about keeping yourself on track and organised. For me, that means establishing a daily routine of tasks (on a timeline) and checking them off as my day progresses. I also include weekly tasks that show up when applicable in that timeline. Finally, I've got a list of unscheduled tasks that need to be completed and not forgotten, so I can keep track of all the ideas I have and things I want to do. 

## Accountability and Rewards

The most important part to task management is a system of accountability. Habitica provides that for me (in the form of damage and eventual death for my avatar) - however, if you choose a different task management platform you may need to create your own accountability system. It can be as simple as asking your friends to help keep you on track, or ensuring that your leisure time does not come until after your tasks are complete. However you choose to do it is up to you, as long as the accountability is in place and you have a system to keep you from going astray. 

Task management should not be *entirely* work and focus - it is important to reward yourself, as well! An example I like to use is if I have completed all of my tasks on time for a week, I allow myself a day off to spend entirely on leisure. Whatever reward system you choose should be effective in keeping you from feeling the burnout.

## Conclusion

There are a number of methods you can use to keep your schedule structured and timelines met. What system do you find works best?
