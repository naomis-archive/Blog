      <h1>Happy Birthday to Me~!</h1>
      <p class="small">18 July 2020</p>
      <p>
        Today is my birthday. Woohoo! I have to say, though... birthdays haven't
        really been something I have seen as necessitating celebration. I'm more
        than happy to celebrate others' birthdays - but my own? Perfectly
        content to let it pass by without a fuss. It just never struck me as
        something to celebrate.

        I have no specific plans for it this year, either. More than likely, it
        will be just another normal day. Write some code, play some video games,
        do nothing extraordinary. I <em>did</em> get to see a comet last night,
        which was absolutely mind-blowing. We went around midnight, so that
        counts as a birthday celebration right?
