      <h1>The 100 Days Of Code Challenge</h1>
      <p class="small">21 July 2020</p>
      <p>
        I finally decided to join the
        <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >100 Days of Code Challenge</a
        >. While I believe I have been coding for over 100 days at this point, I
        was reluctant to commit to the challenge out of fear that it would come
        to feel more like a chore than something I do for entertainment.
        However, with using Habitica for my task management, I've found it to be
        a much more pleasant experience.

        Joining the challenge has also given me reason to actually
        <em>use</em> the Twitter account I created. Additionally, the
        FreeCodeCamp Discord server has a channel for this challenge - while
        I've been encouraging other users in their efforts to complete the daily
        goal, I must admit it is nice to be able to post my own success as well.
