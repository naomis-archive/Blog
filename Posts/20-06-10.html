      <h1>I haven't ideas lately</h1>

      <p>
        For the past few days, I've found that I have lacked inspiration for
        coding projects. I have gone back and tweaked a couple, but I have not
        really built anything new. Today I finally decided to sit down and make
        a new project. After struggling for a couple of hours to find an idea, I
        landed upon creating a Magic: The Gathering card search website.

        I had already used the MTG API in my Discord bot, so I was a little
        familiar with the process. However, the discord bot runs on Heroku which
        allows server-side code. With the intent of publishing this webapge on
        GitHub Pages, I was limited to using the client-side .fetch() request. I
        needed a lot of experimentation to make the code work properly...
      </p>
      <p>
        The fetch function is a Promise, so it returns a Response. Initially, my
        code called the fetch and followed it with a then function, but I was
        running into the issue of the code returning a "Pending Promise", rather
        than the data I was seeking. It took some playing around with the
        async/await commands before I finally landed on a sufficient code.

        The
        <a href="https://www.nhcarrigan.com/mtg-search">MTG Card Search</a>
        project is now live, which is great! But again I run in to the issue of
        a lack of inspiration. I am thinking that the next project might be a
        feeback form, which I can link to all of my projects. I'm not sure
        though.
