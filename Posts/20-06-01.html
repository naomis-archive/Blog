      <h1>Discord Bot</h1>
      <p class="small">1 June 2020</p>
      <p>
        I have spend the past couple of days working on a Discord bot using the
        discord.js library. I had a little experience working on a
        <a href="https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/discord-bot-test"
          >community bot project</a
        >, but this was my first attempt at building one from the ground up. I
        had some help through suggestions from my fellow programmers, and I had
        to reference some of the code we used in that community project, but
        most of the bot was done with my own knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a very good learning process for me. Not only did I learn more
        about the discord.js library, but I took the opportunity to really
        explore the git command line. Learning how to stage files, commit
        changes, and push commits was huge. I created a test repository to try
        commands such as reverting commits, but the repetition I experienced
        with this bot project really made the knowledge stick. I also took the
        opportunity to familiarise myself with GitHub markdown, creating a
        detailed README.me file and issue/pull request templates. Finally, I
        explored the npm command line to add the necessary node packages (such
        as discord.js) to my project
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I had to get the bot set up on a server for 24/7 runtime.
        I originally tried glitch, but the service is simply too unreliable.
        When I had first reached a point where the bot was ready for a live
        deployment, glitch's services were down for quite a few hours. Glitch
        also lacks a CI/CD pipeline. I was looking for other options when I ran
        across Heroku, and with a couple small changes to my project files I was
        able to deploy the bot from my GitHub repository. The benefit here is
        the bot is always online, and will automatically update with any changes
        I push to the repository
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of writing this post, I have run out of ideas for commands
        to add to the bot. The bot is running smoothly in my
        <a href="https://discord.gg/PHqDbkg">Discord server</a>. As I think of
        new ideas to add to the bot, I'll update the repository with the new
        code.
