## Burnout

Burnout is a very real state of mind that many new programmers (or anyone learning a new skill, really) often feel. You have likely heard this term before - "Don't get burnt out", or "I'm really feeling the burnout today" - but what exactly *is* burnout? And how can we prevent it? In this article, we will go over some answers to these questions (and more!).

## What IS burnout?

Burnout is a sudden and significant loss of motivation or interest in a skill, hobby, or learning experience. In terms of software development, burnout is the loss of any desire to write code, or inspiration for new projects. This feeling seemingly comes out of nowhere, catching you off-guard and leaving you listless and disengaged from your code-writing practises. Unfortunately, it is something that happens all too often, especially to newer developers. 

## How can we prevent burnout?

The most important factor in mitigating potential burnout is proper time-management and moderation. I am a firm believer in taking breaks. One of the most common causes that I see for burnout is new developers overworking themselves. Spending 10-12 hours coding for a day or two is one thing (every line of work has "crunch time", and there are often times when you are determined to reach a certain level of functionality in your code before heading off to something else), but doing this *every day* for an extended period of time will leave you drained. Break up that time! Spend 2 hours writing code, then 30 minutes or an hour doing something else. Get up, walk away from the keyboard, and decompress. In fact, you may find that coming back with a fresh mind will improve your overall efficiency!

Sometimes, though, burnout is less about lack of motivation and more about lack of *inspiration*. It can be hard to motivate yourself to write code when you have no idea for what you want the code to *do*. In these situations, it never hurts to search around for projects to practise on, or find open-source work and contribute, or even ask your friends for ideas! The two questions I recommend asking yourself are "What sounds like fun to build?" and "What problem can I solve with some code?" - answering one of these questions should get you moving in the right direction and back on track. 

## What if I am currently burnt out?

The most important thing is *don't force it*. You'll come to resent the idea of coding if you force yourself to do it while you're experiencing burnout. The best recommendation I can provide is to take a couple of days, completely disengage from coding, and enjoy some hobbies or other activities. Relax, decompress, and allow yourself time to recuperate. Set a goal -  "After three days, I'll get back into it and learn this new language". Then stick to it - else you may end up walking away from coding permanently.
