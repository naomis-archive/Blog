# Cloudpunk

*Cloudpunk* is a nice little adventure game / hovercar simulator. You play as Raina, a young(?) woman who has moved to the city of something or other, and is working her first night for an illicit delivery company (also named Cloudpunk).

## Gameplay

### Score: 8/10

The game play is decent, if not a little monotonous. For those familiar with RPGs, this game is essentially one large series of fetch quests. There is a lot of going back and forth across the large map (separated by loading screens, of course) and a lot of following the waypoint on the minimap. I found myself waffling back and forth between finding it to be a nice relaxing pace and being completely bored.

A few of the quests had a time-limit, which felt entirely unnecessary - it ruined the flow of the game and broke that relaxation state, and the sense of urgency was diminished by the fact that you have more than enough time to accomplish the objective. The game also has a vast number of collectibles to find, which I admittedly left untouched (except for the few I HAD to track down, to get past a checkpoint.) It felt more like fluff than actual gameplay.

## Graphics 

### Score: 7/10

I have to admit, when I first saw the character and vehicle models I was thoroughly disappointed. They were blocky, and looked like they had been constructed from LEGO bricks. But... they did grow on me, as I continued to play. 

Where the game really shined was the environments. The bloom effects, the neon glow in the signs, the buildings and skyline, and even the skybox. All of these were impressive and contributed to that sense of a futuristic world. They might not have been realistic, or high definition, but they *worked*. 

The graphics did fall short on a couple of glaring areas: first, the rain. Almost every area in the game has a never-ending rain storm, which is accomplished by a rain animation on the screen. That animation never moves - if you look down, the rain is still falling from the top of your screen to the bottom. Second, the reflections. Puddles of water are present on the ground, and the reflections within them do not match your surroundings. Both of these managed to break my immersion a few times.

Finally, the characters all have portraits that appear during dialogue. These are beautiful, hand-drawn portraits - or, I assume they are. It's hard to tell, because all of them are covered by this "digital static" animation that I assume is meant to represent a poor quality video call. A waste of good assets, IMO.

## Story

### Score: 7/10

The story of the game has a very weak start. I did not find myself truly invested until about halfway through, and even then it still had its cringy moments and obnoxious characters. Huxley, I think, was the most annoying. Still, there were a fair number of times that it managed to hook my emotions, and by the end I was definitely sucked in.

There are a few choices to be made throughout the quest line, and it seems those choices have some minor impact in dialogues toward the end of the game. However, ultimately I cannot say the choices had any real or lasting impact - though admittedly I only went on one playthrough, so I could be wrong. The writing does a very good job of keeping those choices away from a "right and wrong" type answer, instead providing reasons to justify either option (through dialogue between characters). That part was done quite well.

## Audio

### Score: 4/10

This, unfortunately, is where the game fell flat. The music in the game was nice for about the first hour, but ultimately I switched it off entirely as it became too grating and repetitive (I think this was also about when I started actually getting sucked in to the game). 

The voice acting is decent, though there are definitely some lines where the intonation and phrasing just doesn't quite feel right - little moments that were not a deal breaker, but were very much immersion breaking.

## Final Thoughts

### Total: 6.5/10

To be completely honest, I seriously considered uninstalling this game about two hours in and requesting a refund. I am glad, however, that I did not - instead I saw the game through to the end and it was worth it. The game is slow to start, sure, but all that effort you put in will pay off in the end. You might even shed a little tear.
