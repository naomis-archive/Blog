## Asking for Help

Asking for assistance is an important aspect of development (and life in general). The process, however, can be quite daunting, especially to new developers who might be shy, or worried they will appear ignorant or unskilled. Experienced developers will never think this of you, especially if you ask the *right* questions. But how do you do that? There are a few key pieces to asking solid questions: you should know *when* to ask, *who* to ask, and *how* to ask.

## When To Ask

The bulk of my development learning came from the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://freecodecamp.org/learn), where the `Read-Search-Ask` method is heavily promoted. This is an *excellent* method for knowing when it is time to ask someone for assistance. What does this look like?

### Read

When you get stuck, the very first step is to read up on the issue. Read the error messages you get. Read the documentation for the language/library/framework you are using. Read the forums or community resources for that language. 

### Search

If reading does not get you the answer you seek, it is time to start searching. Using a search engine is another skill entirely, but in general it helps to be somewhat specific in your search. 

Say you are writing a `for` loop, and you get an `i is undefined` error in your console.

```md
javascript variable undefined
```

This will get you a lot of different results. Many of these results may not be as helpful or direct as you need. 

```md
javascript for loop iterator undefined
```

This search might provide more targeted and relevant results. 

### Ask

If, after searching, you still do not have an answer, then *now* is the time to ask someone for help. At this point, you've confirmed that the documentation does not provide the information, and a quick search reveals nothing, so the next step is to see if anyone else has encountered this issue. 

(**TIP:** Most people do not mind if you ask a question, but asking something that could have been solved with the first Google search result might irritate some folks).

## Who to Ask

It helps to ask your question of the correct person. You would not find much success asking an Angular developer for help with React, or a game developer for help with your web page. In general, you want to ask people who are most familiar with the technologies related to your question. 

A good option is to join communities centred around that technology. For example, if you are using the `discord.js` package to build a Discord bot, you may consider joining the `discord.js` Discord server. Joining the relevant community, whether a chat room, forum, or other platform, can offer a vast amount of information. Asking solid questions in these communities will often yield positive results. 

## How to Ask

This might be the most essential aspect of this article. Being able to ask questions in an effective manner will greatly facilitate the speed and value of your response.

```md
Does anyone know JavaScript?
```

Asking this question will get you a lot of "Yes" answers, or complete silence. 

```md
I can't get my for loop to run?
```

This is a little more specific, but will still result in a lot of back-and-forth between you and the person you are asking for help. 

A solid question will include the following information:
* The relevant code 
* Any error messages you receive
* The steps you have tried to resolve the issue

For example:

```md
I am having trouble with a for loop in JavaScript. On this line, I am getting an error that "i is not defined". 
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
```

This will allow the developer you are asking to provide a direct and useful response, rather than having to ask repeatedly for more specific information. It is always important to keep in mind that time is valuable, so when asking for assistance you want to convey the information as quickly and efficiently as possible.
